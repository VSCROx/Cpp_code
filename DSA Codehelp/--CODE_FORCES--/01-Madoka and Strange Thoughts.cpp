// Madoka is a very strange girl, and therefore she suddenly wondered how many pairs of integers (a,b) exist, where 1≤a,b≤n, for which lcm(a,b)gcd(a,b)≤3.

// Output
// For each test case output a single integer — the number of pairs of integers satisfying the condition.

// Note
// For n=1 there is exactly one pair of numbers — (1,1) and it fits.
// For n=2, there are only 4 pairs — (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) and they all fit.
// For n=3, all 9 pair are suitable, except (2,3) and (3,2), since their lcm is 6, and gcd is 1, which doesn't fit the condition.
